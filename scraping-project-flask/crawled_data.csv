“Later in the night, Regina Waller, the Fulton County public affairs manager for elections, told ABC News that the election department sent the State Farm Arena absentee ballot counters home at 10:30 p.m. despite earlier intentions to complete processing Tuesday night. Some additional numbers could still come out Tuesday night, but as of now the staff will be back at 8:30 a.m. Wednesday.”

6,"Greece ORDERS private doctors to join COVID-19 battle

https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/greece-orders-private-doctors-join-covid-19-battle-76600943

Greece’s health minister is requisitioning the services of private sector doctors from certain specialties in the wider Athens region to help fight a renewed surge in coronavirus infections that is straining hospitals to their limits.

In an announcement released Monday, Vassilis Kikilias said that despite repeated appeals for private doctors to volunteer to help in the public sector, very few came forward. Therefore, 
>the minister said, he was ordering specialists 
>in pathology, pneumonology and general medicine to help.

>Kikilias had said Friday he would requisition private sector doctors unless at least 200 volunteered within 48 hours. 
Government spokeswoman Aristotelia Peloni said Monday that only 61 doctors had stepped forward voluntarily.

“It was the last measure, if you will, in the context of the emergency plan prepared by the Health Ministry, and it was decided that it was now necessary to mobilize private doctors as part of this great struggle, this national effort, after all the opportunities for voluntary participation were exhausted,” Peloni said.

The requisition order is for one month for 206 doctors, health authorities said.

About 500 people are hospitalized each day with COVID-19, health authorities say, with 200 of them being in the wider Athens region.

On Monday, Greece reported 1,707 new coronavirus infections and 69 more deaths, bringing the total confirmed infections to just under 240,000 and the death toll to 7,531.

>authorities have announced a slight relaxation of lockdown measures, with hairdressers, nail salons and 
>open-air archaeological sites reopening as of Monday.

No, not quite. Asia was populated by two migrations out of the near east. The first took the coastal route and would become the abbos, papuans, negritos and jomon. The second took the inland route and would become the mongoloids. Siberians and Austronesians are of the mongoloid lineage, Jomon are of the more archaic southern lineage.",2021-03-22 17:05:13,313215501
